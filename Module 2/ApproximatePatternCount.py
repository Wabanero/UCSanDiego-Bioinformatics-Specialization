'''ApproximatePatternCount.py:
        Code Challenge:     Implement ApproximatePatternCount.
        Input:              Strings Pattern and Text (both DNA sequences) as well as an integer d.
        Output:             Countd(Text, Pattern): it simply requires us to compute the Hamming distance between Pattern
                            and every k-mer substring of Text, which is achieved by the following pseudocode.

        We say that a k-mer Pattern appears as a substring of Text with at most d mismatches if there is some k-mer
        substring Pattern' of Text having d or fewer mismatches with Pattern, i.e., HammingDistance(Pattern, Pattern')
        â‰¤ d. Our observation that a DnaA box may appear with slight variations leads to the following generalization
        of the Pattern Matching Problem.'''
