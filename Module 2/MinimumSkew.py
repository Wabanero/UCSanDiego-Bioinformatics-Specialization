'''MinimumSkew.py:
        Code Challenge:     Solve the Minimum Skew Problem.
        Input:              A DNA string Genome.
        Output:             All integer(s) i minimizing Skewi (Genome) among all values of i (from 0 to |Genome|).

        Since we don't know the location of ori in a circular genome, let's linearize it (i.e., select an arbitrary
        position and pretend that the genome begins here), resulting in a linear string Genome. We define Skewi(Genome)
        as the difference between the total number of occurrences of G and the total number of occurrences of C in the
        first i nucleotides of Genome. The skew diagram is defined by plotting Skewi (Genome) (as i ranges from 0 to
        |Genome|), where Skew0 (Genome) is set equal to zero. Note that we can compute Skewi+1(Genome) from
        Skewi(Genome) according to the nucleotide in position i of Genome.
        If this nucleotide is G, then Skewi+1(Genome) = Skewi(Genome) + 1;
        if this nucleotide is C, then Skewi+1(Genome)= Skewi(Genome) â€“ 1;
        otherwise, Skewi+1(Genome) = Skewi(Genome).
        An insight for a new algorithm for locating ori: it should be found where the skew attains a minimum.'''
